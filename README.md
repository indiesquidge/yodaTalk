=============
Use a Python simple server to run this. Check if you have Python installed by typing
``` which python ```
into your terminal.

If you don't have Python installed, go [here](https://www.python.org/download/)

Clone repo, navigate into the main directory, and type
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer ```
in to your terminal. It should start serving on a port (like 8000) in your localhost, simply go to 'localhost:8000' to view the app.
